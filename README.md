# learning_ruby
Trying to learn Ruby and Get back up to speed with Rails
So I can build a startup


What is OOP in Ruby?
Classes - A blueprint that describe the state and behaviour that objects share. e.g a User in a system could be defined in a class.

Abstraction - Basically this is grouping behaviour in classes

Inheritance - This is where a class takes a behaviour from another class defined as a super class ands the inheriting class defined as a subclass

Polymorphism - when a class inherits a partial of another class or changes some of its inherited Behaviours

Im falling asleep ...

Encapsulation - blocking off areas of code

MODULES

a module is similar to a class but is a collection of behaviors that other classes can use

You cannot have an object of a module

RAILS

You create a new application by

rails new appname

/rails_samples

/routes for routes of app

/assets 

/stylesheets

/helpers common logic for views
